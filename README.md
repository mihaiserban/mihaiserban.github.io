Codebase of my personal website, [navoshta.com](https://navoshta.com). It's a blog about things I happen to work with. Mainly itâ€™s developing iOS apps and frameworks, data mining and machine learning.

It is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is based on [Minimal Mistakes Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
