Hey – I'm Alex Staravoitau, a full-stack software engineer with a surname you're gonna struggle to pronounce. I mainly do **iOS development** these days, although I am highly keen on **data science** and **machine learning**, and this complicated hobby is taking most of my spare time. Not to mention I'm a huge fan of astrophysics, music and good design.

My commercial experience dates back to 2008, I used to work in telecom, banking, media, hospitality, travel, healthcare, gambling and have done multiple projects related to information security. 

## About the site

This is a blog about things I happen to work with. Mainly it's developing iOS apps and frameworks, data mining and machine learning.
