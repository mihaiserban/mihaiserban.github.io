So one Saturday I got particularly bored and thought I should configure my Jupyter Notebook a bit. <!--more--> What I wanted to achieve:

* Remove annoying Jupyter logo
* Use a better monospaced font
* Make syntax highlighting look like the Xcode default one

I'm not a huge fan of dark schemes and wanted to have some familiarity with Xcode syntax highlighting, so I forked [a neat looking solution](https://github.com/neilpanchal/iPython-Notebook-Theme) that already had header logo disabled, and then spent a couple of hours making sure the colours match to those of Xcode. 

Without further ado, this is what it looks like. I was pretty pleased with the result and have been using it ever since (e.g. for a couple of months now).

You can, of course, get this theme [on GitHub](https://github.com/navoshta/Jupyter-Notebook-Theme):

 You can find detailed installation instructions following [this link](https://github.com/nsonnad/base16-ipython-notebook). Although for me it was as easy as placing the `custom.css` file in the `~/.jupyter/custom` folder on both my macOS and Ubuntu machines.

Final note: if you don't have Apple's `Menlo` font installed you may want to check out its open source alternative [`Meslo`](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font).
